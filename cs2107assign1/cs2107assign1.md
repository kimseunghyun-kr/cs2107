brute force height to find out what is the height ~904 but lower still can find for some reason although image is truncated,

able to just use the encoded bytes as ecb method is deterministic with the same IV used to encode image in each chunk(block). this means that for a large enough area with same initial bytes, will be encoded to the same bytes, able to identify the image out even though it is encrypted

credits to the above dude to help undo the checksum and doesnt need me to do the brute force on all possible 2^32 bytes
